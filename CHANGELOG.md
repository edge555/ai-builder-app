# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [1.11.0.0] - 2026-04-23

### Added
- **Delivery gate for generated and modified apps** - new shared delivery approval pass now checks structural acceptance, heuristic runtime smoke, and bounded repair before the app is allowed to ship to the user.
- **Typed quality report contract** - generation and modification failures now return a structured `qualityReport` so backend, frontend, and tests agree on why delivery failed and how far repair got.
- **Production runtime smoke checks** - the runtime smoke harness now lives in backend core and is shared by both production delivery and eval coverage.

### Changed
- **Generation now fails closed** - the streaming and non-streaming generation paths only return success after delivery approval. Exhausted repair no longer falls through as a "best effort" success.
- **Modification now uses the same approval gate** - post-edit delivery uses the same shared contract as generation, while still preserving rollback-derived partial success when the final project is approved.
- **Frontend failure handling is clearer** - typed backend delivery failures now flow through SSE parsing, API services, and user-facing error messages so the UI can explain whether the app failed structure checks, runtime smoke, or repair.

### Fixed
- **Preview auto-repair trigger noise** - `WebContainerErrorListener` now ignores generic install chatter and only reacts to recognized fatal install or server signals, which cuts false repair pressure on first boot.
- **Streaming success semantics** - generation streams no longer emit terminal success when the backend rejected delivery.
- **Regression coverage for the new gate** - backend and frontend tests now cover delivery rejection, shared runtime smoke parity, modification gate failures, and the tightened preview listener behavior.
- **No double-scan after repair** - repair callback now returns `finalEvaluation` so the delivery gate reuses it instead of running a duplicate full-project scan on every repair cycle.
- **Error boundary false positives** - runtime smoke test now strips catch blocks before checking for top-level throws, so React error boundaries no longer incorrectly fail delivery.
- **Unknown framework passes trivially** - projects with unrecognized entry point paths now surface an `unknown_framework` issue and enter repair, rather than silently passing the smoke test.
- **Repair AI file-count guard** - repair responses that return fewer than 50% of the original project files are rejected to prevent AI hallucination from silently deleting most of the project.
- **Quality report validation** - `qualityReport` received over SSE or from non-2xx API responses is validated with `QualityReportSchema` before propagation, so malformed data never reaches the UI.

## [1.10.2] - 2026-04-23

### Removed
- **BeginnerMode** — simplified UI toggle and all associated pipeline scaffolding removed.
- **Workspace / org / admin system** — workspace context, org API, member routes, admin session viewer, workspace resolver, AES-256-GCM org API key encryption, and all related Supabase calls removed.
- **Cloud storage (HybridStorageService)** — cloud sync removed; `getUniqueProjectName()` migrated to `StorageService`.
- **Server-side session history** — `session-service.ts`, `SESSION_CONTEXT_K / SESSION_CONTEXT_MAX_TOKENS` env vars, and conversation history injection removed.
- **StackBlitz "Open in IDE" button** — removed from the builder header.
- **Import Local Projects dialog** — file-system import flow removed.
- **Dead config entries** — `WORKSPACE_MASTER_KEY`, `SESSION_CONTEXT_K`, `SESSION_CONTEXT_MAX_TOKENS` removed from `config.ts`.

### Added
- **WebContainer boot progress bar** — collapsible progress indicator with line-count heuristic and "Show details" toggle.
- **Mobile auto-switch to preview** — auto-switches to Preview panel on generation finish on ≤ 1024px viewports.
- **Complex-generation slow warning** — apps with > 10 files show "complex builds typically take 2–4 minutes".
- **Human-readable error panel** — plain-language summary first; raw technical details collapsed behind toggle.
- **Feedback button** — persistent link in site header.

### Fixed
- Mobile auto-switch effect used stale closure values; fixed with refs updated each render cycle.
- Removed stale `vi.mock` for deleted `workspace-resolver` in API integration test suite.
- Removed orphaned `useMemberAutoSave` hook.
- Removed dead config entries (`WORKSPACE_MASTER_KEY`, `SESSION_CONTEXT_*`).
- Removed double blank line in `acceptance-gate.ts`.

## [1.10.1] - 2026-04-23

### Removed
- **Modal AI provider** — `modal-client.ts`, `modal-pipeline-factory.ts`, and `modal-response-parser.ts` deleted. The backend is now OpenRouter-only. `AI_PROVIDER=modal` in `.env` falls back to `openrouter` via legacy normalization. All Modal-specific constants (`MODAL_MAX_OUTPUT_TOKENS_*`), env-var docs, and provider-routing branches removed. `createPromptProvider()` is now a no-arg function; `AIProviderName` narrowed to `'openrouter'` only.

### Fixed
- `extractJsonFromResponse` and `parseStructuredOutput` moved to `structured-output.ts` with expanded test coverage (15 cases covering direct parse, markdown blocks, brace matching, and null/failure paths).

## [1.10.0] - 2026-04-15

### Added
- **Reliable continuation (server-side session tracking)** — `project_sessions` and `session_messages` tables with RLS policies track every AI turn per workspace member. `session-service.ts` exposes `getOrCreateSession`, `appendTurn` (fire-and-forget), and `getLastKTurns` for conversation history injection.
- **Conversation history injection** — `generate-stream` and `modify-stream` routes retrieve the last 10 turns from the active session and prepend them as a `[CONVERSATION HISTORY]` block in the AI system prompt, enabling coherent multi-turn interactions without client-side re-sending. Both user and assistant turns are recorded atomically on success only (no orphaned turns on stream failure).
- **Admin session viewer endpoints** — `GET /api/admin/workspaces/:wid/sessions` (keyset-paginated list), `GET /api/admin/sessions/:sessionId` (full transcript, capped at 500 messages), `GET /api/admin/sessions/:sessionId/export` (JSONL export, capped at 5000 messages). All require workspace-admin auth.
- **`SESSION_CONTEXT_K` / `SESSION_CONTEXT_MAX_TOKENS` config** — new env vars (defaults: 10 turns, 6000 token budget) control session history injection depth and size.
- **Supabase migration** — `20260415_reliable_continuation.sql` creates `project_sessions` (with `idx_project_sessions_one_active` unique partial index) and `session_messages` (with GIN index on content).
- **Spec** — `specs/reliable-continuation.md` documents the full design, schema, and implementation decisions.

### Fixed
- **`AcceptanceGate` scoped validation** — `resolveBuildValidationScope` previously only traversed dependents (files that import changed files) but missed dependencies (files that the changed files import). Both directions are now included, preventing false "missing import" build errors on scoped modifications. `package.json` is also included in scope when any changed file imports an external package.
- **Admin sessions pagination** — replaced in-memory cursor filtering (capped at 200 rows) with SQL keyset pagination via PostgREST `.or()` filter; cursor tokens are now validated against UUID and ISO datetime regexes before use.
- **Transcript payload guard** — `GET /api/admin/sessions/:sessionId` now caps `session_messages` fetch at 500 rows, preventing unbounded response payloads on long sessions.

## [1.9.0] - 2026-04-09

### Added
- **Beginner/classroom-safe generation mode** — workspaces can now enable `beginner_mode`, which constrains generated output to 4-6 file React SPAs with no `fetch()`/`axios` calls and at least two event handlers. `AcceptanceGate.validate()` enforces these constraints and rejects non-compliant output.
- **`HeuristicPlanBuilder`** — deterministic fallback plan for beginner mode. Recognises keyword clusters (counter, todo, quiz, form, calculator) and produces a 5-file plan with the correct component stub; falls back to a safe 4-file generic plan. Eliminates AI planning latency for the classroom path.
- **`react-spa-beginner` recipe** — new pluggable generation recipe with prompt fragments that explicitly prohibit network calls and guide the model toward simple state-only patterns. Automatically selected when `beginnerMode` is `true`, overriding intent-based recipe selection.
- **Admin workspace API endpoints** — `GET /api/org/:orgId/workspaces/:wid` (workspace detail) and `PATCH /api/org/:orgId/workspaces/:wid` (update name or `beginner_mode`). Both require org-admin auth and double-check IDOR (`org_id` cross-reference).
- **Admin workspace metrics endpoint** — `GET /api/org/:orgId/workspaces/:wid/metrics` returns per-member generation event counts and repair-trigger rates for the admin dashboard.
- **Admin UI: beginner mode toggle** — `AdminWorkspacePage` now shows a "Classroom (beginner) mode" toggle that calls the new PATCH endpoint. Visual indicator appears on enabled workspaces.
- **Supabase migration** — `20260409_beginner_mode.sql` adds `beginner_mode boolean NOT NULL DEFAULT false` to the `workspaces` table.
- **Classroom eval infrastructure** — `classroom-baseline.test.ts`, `live-eval-suite.ts`, and `reference-prompts.ts` provide a repeatable eval harness for the 5 classroom prompt types. Baseline report committed at 40% pass rate (pre JSON-format fix).

### Changed
- **`WorkspaceResolveResult`** now includes `beginnerMode: boolean`, propagated through `resolveWorkspaceProvider` → `generate-stream` route → `generateProjectStreaming` → `runGeneration` → `selectRecipe` and `AcceptanceGate.validate()`.
- **`HeuristicPlanBuilder` wired up** — `generation-pipeline.ts` now calls `buildHeuristicPlan()` when in beginner mode (bypasses AI planning entirely) and as the fallback when `resolveArchitecturePlan()` throws.
- **JSON output format enforced** — `PhaseExecutor` system prompts now explicitly require JSON output with no markdown fences. Fixes the root cause of the 40% classroom baseline failure rate where Gemini/minimax returned markdown code blocks the incremental JSON parser could not parse.
- **`SupabaseJwk` type** — `auth.ts` uses a more specific `SupabaseJwk` type (extends `JsonWebKey` with optional `kid`) for `jwksCache` and `fetchJwks`, eliminating implicit `any` casts in the JWKS verification path.

### Fixed
- **`lightValidate` available in PATCH handler** — `ModificationEngine` previously lacked a pre-repair validation shortcut. `AcceptanceGate.lightValidate()` (structural + placeholder, no build validation) is now exposed and used by the modification pipeline.

## [1.8.1] - 2026-04-07

### Changed
- **GenerationContext refactor** — extracted streaming transport, API service, and repair logic into dedicated modules under `frontend/src/context/generation/`. The React provider now owns only UI state; transport and retry logic live in `generationApiService`, `repairService`, and `streamingTransport`.
- **`StreamingState` re-exported** — backward-compatible type alias preserved in `GenerationContext.context.ts` so existing consumers (`ChatInterface`, `StreamingIndicator`) require no changes.

### Fixed
- **`onStreamingChange(false)` race** — the streaming-change callback was called unconditionally in the `finally` block of `runStreamingRequest`, which could flip `isStreaming` to `false` while a second stream was still running. Now only fires when the finishing session is the current active session.
- **Repair deduplication blocking retries** — `lastRepairErrorKey` was never reset between attempts, capping the 5-attempt repair loop at 1 in practice. Key is now cleared in `finally` so each completed attempt allows the next one to run.

## [1.8.0] - 2026-04-06

### Added
- **`AcceptanceGate.lightValidate()`** — new light-weight variant that runs structural + placeholder checks without build validation. `ModificationEngine` now uses this for pre-repair acceptance, letting `DiagnosticRepairEngine` own build validation in its repair loop.
- **4-mode modification routing** — `classifyModificationComplexity` now returns one of four explicit modes (`repair | direct | scoped | full`) with named constants (`SMALL_PROJECT_FILE_THRESHOLD = 12`, `SIMPLE_PROMPT_MAX_LENGTH = 220`) in `constants.ts`.
- **`COMPLEX_MODIFICATION_CUES` guard** — scoped routing now requires the prompt to be free of complexity cue words (refactor, rewrite, architecture, migrate, etc.), preventing AI-heavy modifications from being under-planned.
- **`ModificationRoutingDecision` exported** — the routing decision interface is now part of the public API so callers can type the result of `classifyModificationComplexity`.
- **New test files** — `acceptance-gate.test.ts` (placeholder detection, `lightValidate`, false-positive guard), `modification-engine-complexity.test.ts` (routing boundary cases), `modification-engine-routing.test.ts` (pipeline dispatch and full-mode degradation), `vitest.config.mjs`.

### Fixed
- **Scoped modification false rejection** — `changedPaths` was built with `Object.keys(deletedFiles)` where `deletedFiles` is `string[]`, producing array indices (`'0'`) as unexpected file paths. Now uses `Object.keys(updatedFiles)` only (deleted files are already included as null-value keys).
- **Scoped mode now degrades to full mode** — when a scoped or direct modification touches files outside the selected slices, instead of returning `success: false`, the engine retries with full routing (`_forceFullRouting: true`). Silent failures are eliminated.
- **`PLACEHOLDER_PATTERNS` false positives** — `/implement this file/i` and `/subsequent phases/i` patterns are now comment-anchored (`\/\/.*`) so they only fire on JS/TS comment lines, not on string values or JSX content in user apps.
- **`isAllowedSupportFile` over-permissive** — previously allowed any `.ts/.tsx/.css` file through the targeted-change guard, including existing files being unexpectedly modified. Now only permits newly-created files (not present in the original project).
- **`shouldSkipPlanning` no longer forces `skipIntent`** — explicit planning-skip override is now independent of the intent stage, so intent can still run when planning is skipped.
- **`applyParseWarnings` deduplication** — phase executor continuation calls no longer re-emit the same malformed-JSON warning from a prior chunk.

### Changed
- **`AcceptanceGate.validate()`** refactored into `structuralValidate()` (private, shared) + build validation layer, keeping the public API identical while enabling the new `lightValidate()` path.

## [1.7.0] - 2026-04-05

### Added
- **AcceptanceGate** — new abstraction (`backend/lib/core/acceptance-gate.ts`) that consolidates `ValidationPipeline.validate()` + `BuildValidator.validateAll()` + `BuildValidator.validateCrossFileReferences()` into a single `validate(files): AcceptanceResult` call. All generation and repair paths now flow through a single acceptance boundary.
- **Eval harness** — deterministic benchmark suite (`backend/lib/core/__tests__/eval/`) with fixtures, eval cases, and a harness that runs generation and modification scenarios against the acceptance gate without live AI calls. Covers generation pattern matching, cross-file reference checks, and modification scope isolation.
- **Live eval suite** — `eval:live` backend script exercises the full generation pipeline against real AI providers, reporting acceptance-gate pass rates and timing metrics.
- **Planning retry** — `GenerationPipeline.resolveArchitecturePlan()` retries planning once on schema parse failure before propagating the error. The retry prompt includes a strict "JSON only" instruction to recover from verbose AI responses.
- **Phase file-count enforcement** — multi-phase generation now throws immediately if a phase returns fewer files than planned, preventing silent partial output from reaching the acceptance gate.
- **`parseStructuredOutput` utility** — centralized JSON extraction + Zod validation with consistent error labels (`'${label} parse failed'`, `'${label} schema mismatch'`).
- **`state` error type** — new frontend error type for project-state inconsistency, with user-facing message and recovery suggestion.
- **Hybrid storage for generation saves** — `useSubmitPrompt` now writes through `hybridStorageService` (local + cloud) instead of the local-only `storageService`, so projects appear in the gallery immediately after generation for authenticated users.
- **Gallery re-sync on return** — `AppInner` re-fetches project metadata whenever the user navigates back to `/`, ensuring the gallery reflects projects saved during workspace sessions.
- **`HybridStorageService.getAllProjectMetadata` merge** — authenticated users now see both local and cloud projects merged by ID, newest-first, preventing cloud-sync lag from hiding unsyced local projects.

### Changed
- **All phase failures are now hard-fail** — previously non-scaffold phases recorded a warning and continued; they now throw immediately. A partial multi-phase output is no longer accepted.
- **Planning fallback removed** — heuristic plan fallback on planning failure has been removed. Planning failures now propagate as errors (with one retry).
- **`errorType` propagated through SSE** — `parseSSEStream` now includes `errorType` in the returned result object, and `useSubmitPrompt` prefers the server-supplied `errorType` over client-side detection.
- **`DiagnosticRepairEngine` uses `AcceptanceGate`** — repair engine receives an `AcceptanceGate` via `RepairRequest` instead of calling `buildValidator.validate()` directly.

### Fixed
- **Test suite alignment** — 22 in-branch test failures resolved: updated mocks to match `AcceptanceGate` interface (`validateAll` / `validateCrossFileReferences`), fixed `processFiles` mock shape, corrected phase-executor error message format, and aligned `errorType` assertion.

## [1.6.0] - 2026-04-04

### Security
- **X-User-Id header injection patched** — middleware now strips client-supplied `X-User-Id` from all incoming requests before any early-return path (OPTIONS, public routes, dev mode without JWT secret). Previously, an attacker could forge this header to bypass auth entirely when `SUPABASE_JWT_SECRET` was not configured.
- **UNIQUE constraints added** — `members(workspace_id, email)` prevents duplicate invite detection code from silently never firing; `organizations(admin_user_id)` prevents concurrent self-provision from creating two orgs for the same user.
- **HTML injection fixed in invite email** — `display_name`, workspace name, and org name are now HTML-escaped before interpolation into the invite email body.
- **JWKS fetch checks res.ok** — `fetchJwks` now throws on non-2xx so ES256 token verification fails closed (returns null) instead of parsing an error body.
- **nodejs runtime on org/settings route** — `crypto.ts` uses `Buffer` (Node.js builtin); added `export const runtime = 'nodejs'` to prevent Turbopack silently unregistering the route.

### Fixed
- **CORS on all auth error responses** (ISSUE-001, ISSUE-005) — `requireAuth()` and middleware 401/503 responses now include `Access-Control-Allow-Origin`.
- **OPTIONS preflight no longer 401s** (ISSUE-005b/c) — middleware passes OPTIONS requests through without auth-checking them.
- **ES256 JWT support** (ISSUE-006) — Supabase uses ES256; `verifySupabaseToken` now fetches keys from JWKS with a 5-minute cache.
- **Async route params** (ISSUE-006) — Next.js 15+ made dynamic route params a Promise; all `[orgId]`, `[wid]`, `[token]`, `[pid]` handlers updated to `await params`.
- **Node.js crypto in edge runtime** (ISSUE-007) — added `export const runtime = 'nodejs'` to routes importing from Node.js `crypto`.
- **OnboardingPage navigation** (ISSUE-002) — replaced `navigate()` in JSX render with `<Navigate>` component.
- **Fraunces font on admin/join headlines** (ISSUE-003) — added missing `font-family: var(--font-display)` to 24px+ headlines.
- **CLAUDE.md route paths** (ISSUE-004) — corrected wrong URL paths in routing docs.

### Tests
- Added `crypto.test.ts` (7 tests), `workspace-resolver.test.ts` (5 tests), and 8 new tests in `auth.test.ts` covering ES256 JWKS, requireAuth X-User-Id trust, and CORS headers on error responses.

## [1.5.0] - 2026-04-04

### Added
- **Blank Canvas Admin** — organizations can now invite members to a shared workspace where all AI generation uses the org's own API key. Admins manage invites, monitor member projects, and configure org settings from a dedicated dashboard.
- **WorkspaceContext** — frontend now carries workspace-scoped identity through generation and modification requests. When a user is in a workspace session, their API calls automatically use the org's encrypted API key rather than the default provider.
- **Member pages** — four new member-facing routes: workspace picker (choose between personal and org workspace), member builder (full app builder scoped to a workspace project), member join (accept invite flow), and onboarding (first-time workspace setup).
- **Admin pages** — dedicated admin UI: dashboard (overview of members and projects), members list (invite, remove, role management), project browser (view all member projects), org settings (rename org, rotate API key, customize labels).
- **Invite API** (`/api/invite`) — admin issues invite tokens; members redeem them to join a workspace. Tokens are single-use and time-limited.
- **Member project API** (`/api/member/projects`) — members save and load projects scoped to their workspace. Auto-save triggers after each successful generation or modification.
- **Org settings API** (`/api/org/:orgId/settings`) — admins read and update org name, custom labels, and API key. Key is encrypted at rest with AES-256-GCM before storage; the plaintext never leaves the server.
- **AES-256-GCM API key encryption** (`backend/lib/security/crypto.ts`) — org API keys encrypted with a server-side master key (`WORKSPACE_MASTER_KEY`). Decryption errors are caught and logged without propagating 500s to members.
- **Workspace provider resolution** (`backend/lib/security/workspace-resolver.ts`) — validates membership, fetches org API key, decrypts it, and returns a workspace-scoped `AIProvider`. Falls through to default provider when Supabase is not configured or org has no key set.
- **Database migration** (`supabase/migrations/20260404_add_blank_canvas_admin.sql`) — new tables: `organizations`, `workspaces`, `members`, `workspace_projects`, `workspace_project_snapshots`. Row-level security enforces org boundaries.
- **Auto-save with user feedback** (`useMemberAutoSave`) — project files save to the backend after every streaming completion. Save failures now surface a toast notification so members know their changes may not be persisted.

### Security
- **IDOR fix in snapshot upsert** — `modify-stream` snapshot now validates that the client-supplied `projectId` belongs to the authenticated `workspaceId` before writing. Previously, any workspace member could overwrite another workspace's snapshot by sending an arbitrary `projectId`.
- **Decryption error containment** — `decryptApiKey()` in workspace-resolver is now wrapped in a try-catch; corrupted or tampered ciphertext returns `null` (falls through to default provider) instead of an unhandled 500.
- **Org name update fixed** — `UpdateSettingsSchema` was missing the `name` field; `PUT /api/org/:orgId/settings` with only `name` returned a 400 "No fields to update" error and silently dropped the change. Fixed.
- **Dead import removed** — unused `extractBearerToken` import removed from `generate-stream/route.ts`.

## [1.4.0] - 2026-03-29

### Performance
- **Simple edits now use 1 AI call** — the pipeline skips intent and planning for single- or two-file changes, repair mode, and small projects (≤8 files); complex multi-file changes still run the full 3-stage pipeline
- **Modifications are faster and more reliable** — review stage removed (was a 32k-token AI call re-reading all merged files); pipeline now goes Intent → Planning → Execution
- **Less input token usage** — context files capped at 8 slices using outlines (signatures only) instead of full content; modification prompts now include the project file map for structural awareness

### Changed
- **Small files use full-replacement by default** — the AI is now told to return complete file content (`replace_file`) for files under 200 lines, instead of search/replace patches; eliminates the main class of modification match failures
- **Small projects skip the AI file planner** — for projects with ≤8 files, files are selected via keyword matching against file names instead of an AI planning call

### Added
- **Automatic fallback when edits fail** — if a search/replace operation can't find its target, the engine automatically retries with a full-file replacement; path-validated so the AI can't create new files or touch unrelated paths
- **Line numbers in file content** — primary files shown to the AI now include line numbers, improving search/replace precision for the cases where it's still used

### Removed
- Review stage from the modification pipeline (was `PipelineOrchestrator` stage 4); build validation + auto-repair cover the same ground more efficiently

### For contributors
- `classifyModificationComplexity(slices, fileCount, errorContext)` — exported function that decides whether to skip intent/planning; 10 test cases in `modification-engine-complexity.test.ts`
- `retryWithReplaceFileFallback` — path-validated: only accepts paths that were in the failed-edit set AND exist in `currentFiles`
- `runOrderedModificationPipeline` now accepts `skipIntent`/`skipPlanning` options, consistent with `runModificationPipeline`
- Removed: `ReviewOutputSchema`, `ReviewOutput`, `MAX_OUTPUT_TOKENS_REVIEW`, `MODAL_MAX_OUTPUT_TOKENS_REVIEW`, `MAX_REVIEW_CONTENT_CHARS`

### Fixed
- Word-boundary matching in heuristic file selector (was substring — `"app"` incorrectly matched `"application"`)

## [1.3.6] - 2026-03-27

### Performance
- **True one-shot execution path** — projects with ≤10 files now issue a single AI call instead of two sequential scaffold+UI calls, saving 10-20s per generation
- **Skip plan review for simple projects** — plan review AI call (4096 tokens, ~5-10s) is skipped for ≤10 file projects; complex projects (>10 files) still run full review
- **Intent→Planning latency overlap** — planning AI call fires immediately after intent resolves, with recipe selection running synchronously (<1ms) while planning is in flight; saves 2-5s
- **File summary cache** — `buildPhaseContext()` now accepts an optional `summaryCache: Map<string, FileSummary>` to avoid re-summarizing scaffold files on every phase; `executeMultiPhase()` creates the cache once and threads it through all phases
- **Remove redundant post-pipeline validation** — `validationPipeline.validate()` (incl. TypeScript syntax parsing) removed from `streaming-generator.ts`; per-phase `PhaseExecutor` already validates syntax with retry; build-fix loop is the final safety net

### Added
- `ExecutionLayer = PhaseLayer | 'oneshot'` type in `schemas.ts` — internal-only virtual layer for the one-shot execution path; kept separate from `PhaseLayerEnum` so AI planning schema is not affected
- `expectedFiles?: string[]` override on `PhaseDefinition` — enables truncation detection for the oneshot layer (files have no 'oneshot' layer in the plan)
- `getPhasePrompt('oneshot', ...)` case in `UnifiedPromptProvider` — delegates to `getExecutionGenerationSystemPrompt()` with the architecture plan, so the AI knows which files to generate
- `tokenBudgets.oneshot` set to `MAX_OUTPUT_TOKENS_GENERATION` in all prompt providers

### Fixed
- One-shot continuation prompt now lists already-generated file paths to prevent broken imports when truncation retry fires
- Oneshot prompt now passes `ArchitecturePlan` to `getExecutionGenerationSystemPrompt()` so the AI sees the planned file list; previously passed `null` causing the AI to guess the file structure
- `phase-executor.ts` now hard-fails for `oneshot` layer when zero files are generated (same guard that existed for `scaffold`)
- `streaming-generator.ts` now returns an error when all generated files have syntax errors instead of silently passing them to the build-fix loop
- `executeMultiPhase()` now invalidates summary cache entries when a file is regenerated, preventing stale summaries in cross-phase context

### Tests
- Added 15 new tests covering all 5 optimization phases: summary cache hits/misses, plan review gate (file count threshold), review stage events when skipped, abort signal stops planning, executePhase once for oneshot, multi-phase routing for >10 files, expectedFiles override, continuation prompt content, syntax-error file drop, validationPipeline not called

## [1.3.5] - 2026-03-27

### Added
- **Embedded CSS library** — `CSS_LIBRARY_BASE` (buttons, cards, forms, layout, typography, utilities) and `CSS_LIBRARY_FULL` (toasts, modals, skeletons, tabs, badges, alerts) are now verbatim-injected into generation prompts; AI copies real CSS instead of inventing it, eliminating the primary source of visual inconsistency
- **Complexity-gated CSS injection** — `getCSSLibrary(complexity)` returns BASE for simple apps and FULL for medium/complex apps, keeping simple prompts lean
- **Domain color detection** — `getDesignSystemConstants()` detects app domain (finance, recipe, todo, e-commerce, etc.) from the user prompt and injects matching primary/secondary color variables
- **Design system constants always-on** — DESIGN_SYSTEM_CONSTANTS (spacing, radius, shadow, animation tokens) injected unconditionally into all generation prompts regardless of verboseGuidance flag
- **Mobile-first responsive patterns** — `LAYOUT_FUNDAMENTALS` upgraded with fluid typography via `clamp()`, 44px touch targets, mobile nav patterns (hamburger/bottom tab), bottom sheets, and `-webkit-overflow-scrolling: touch`
- **Image handling guidance** — `REALISTIC_DATA_GUIDANCE` upgraded with aspect-ratio containers, lazy loading, `onError` fallback pattern with sibling div overlay, and avatar initials fallback

### Fixed
- **Multi-phase complexity bug** — `phase-prompts.ts` was reading `plan.complexity` which doesn't exist on `ArchitecturePlan` (always `undefined`); medium/complex multi-phase apps were silently falling back to BASE CSS only; fixed by using `detectComplexity(userPrompt)` instead

### Tests
- Added 9 new tests covering CSS library tier gating (`getCSSLibrary` simple/medium/complex), domain color detection (finance/recipe/todo), and DESIGN_SYSTEM_CONSTANTS always-on behavior (verboseGuidance true/false/default); total: 26 prompt provider tests

## [1.3.4] - 2026-03-24

### Performance
- **Self-hosted fonts** — replaced Google Fonts CDN with `@fontsource` packages (`geist-sans`, `geist-mono`, `fraunces`), eliminating a ~2950ms render-blocking external network request that was blocking First Contentful Paint
- **CSP tightened** — removed `fonts.googleapis.com` from `style-src` and `fonts.gstatic.com` from `font-src`; fonts now served from same origin

### Fixed
- **OnboardingOverlay** — replaced hardcoded `font-family: 'Fraunces'` with `var(--font-display)` CSS variable for consistency

## [1.3.3] - 2026-03-24

### Security
- **Next.js 14 → 16** — clears 4 HIGH CVEs (GHSA-ggv3-7p47-pfv8, GHSA-h25m-26qc-wcjf, GHSA-9g9p-9gw9-jx7f, GHSA-3x4c-7pq8) in the backend server
- **Auth guard on config routes** — `PUT /api/agent-config` and `PUT /api/provider-config` now require a valid Supabase JWT; returns 503 when `SUPABASE_JWT_SECRET` is not configured so callers can distinguish "not configured" from "forbidden"
- **Credential scanning** — added `.gitleaks.toml` with custom rules for OpenRouter, Modal, and Supabase keys; run `gitleaks detect` before pushing to catch secrets before they land in history
- **`.env.example` hardening** — production warning added to `SUPABASE_JWT_SECRET` explaining that omitting it leaves config routes unprotected

### Fixed
- **TypeScript strict mode** — 6 pre-existing type errors surfaced by Next.js 16's stricter compilation: incorrect `EventPriority` import source, non-existent `config.ai.*` property references, Zod v4 `.default()` type mismatch, filter/map type narrowing in pipeline orchestrator, removed non-existent `ValidationError.file` property, `Uint8Array` → `BufferSource` cast for Web Crypto API
- **`request.ip` removal** — Next.js 16 removed `NextRequest.ip`; IP extraction now falls back entirely to X-Forwarded-For with configurable proxy depth

### For contributors
- `backend/tsconfig.json` now excludes `vitest.config.ts` from Next.js type-checking (was causing false type errors in CI)
- `@types/uuid` added as devDependency (Next.js 16 resolves uuid to esm-browser entry without bundled types)

## [1.3.2] - 2026-03-23

### Changed
- **Unified prompt provider** — merged `ApiPromptProvider` and `ModalPromptProvider` into a single `UnifiedPromptProvider` class configured via `PromptProviderConfig`. API and Modal paths now share identical prompt text; only token budgets and verbose guidance flag differ. Eliminates ~350 lines of duplicated prompt logic.
- `PromptProviderFactory` simplified — `createPromptProvider('modal')` passes token budget overrides and `verboseGuidance: true`; `createPromptProvider('openrouter')` uses defaults.

### For contributors
- New `UnifiedPromptProvider` test suite (17 cases) in `backend/lib/core/prompts/__tests__/` covering API defaults, Modal overrides, verbose guidance across generation/modification/bugfix prompts, recipe dispatch, phase prompt routing, and dynamic token budgets.
- `backend/lib/core/prompts/api/` and `backend/lib/core/prompts/modal/` directories removed.

## [1.3.1] - 2026-03-22

### Added
- **Onboarding redesign** — style options renamed to Editorial, Energetic, and Polished; Next button is now disabled until a project type is selected; backdrop click closes the dialog; a brief "Starting..." state fires before generation begins so the transition feels intentional
- **Image attachment UX** — attach button shows "Maximum 5 images reached" when at the limit; submit button shows "Waiting for images to upload..." while uploads are in progress; placeholder text hints at paste/drop support
- **Mobile touch target fix** — image thumbnail remove buttons are always visible on touch devices (previously only appeared on hover)
- **Logger value redaction tightened** — sensitive key patterns (api_key, redis_url, jwt_secret, etc.) redact the entire value; string value scanning is narrowed to high-confidence patterns only (bearer tokens, JWTs), preventing false positives like "token-limit-exceeded" from being partially redacted
- **Redis rate limiter fallback** — when Redis is unavailable (error, timeout, or OOM), the rate limiter switches to an in-memory sliding window that still enforces limits; legitimate traffic continues and over-limit requests are still blocked

### Changed
- API request schemas now enforce max-length constraints: project name ≤ 200 chars, description ≤ 5,000 chars, conversation turn content ≤ 5,000 chars
- Font loading split: Geist (body/code) loads synchronously as critical CSS; Fraunces (headlines) loads asynchronously with a Georgia fallback to avoid render blocking
- Updated Content Security Policy in index.html for tighter security posture

### Removed
- `BrowserChrome` component and its associated styles and tests — removed as unused infrastructure

### For contributors
- `SENSITIVE_KEY_PATTERNS` and `SENSITIVE_VALUE_PATTERNS` separated in `logger.ts` — key-name patterns redact values entirely; value patterns are high-confidence only
- Redis rate limiter test suite rewritten: fallback tests now verify in-memory enforcement (third request blocked), not just fail-open behavior
- `OnboardingOverlay` test suite added: Next disabled state, style label names, backdrop click, skip link behavior

## [1.3.0] - 2026-03-21

### Added
- **Diagnostic repair engine** — smarter error recovery that escalates through four tiers: deterministic fixes → targeted AI (temp 0.2) → broad AI (temp 0.4) → per-file rollback. Batches all errors into single AI calls, cutting worst-case repair cost from ~48K to ~18K output tokens
- **Deterministic fixes** — zero-cost fixes for missing dependencies, broken imports, export mismatches, and unclosed syntax errors before any AI call
- **Root cause analyzer** — hybrid dependency-graph + AI analysis traces build errors back to the file that actually caused them, focusing repair on the right target
- **Diff size guard** — auto-converts modify operations to full replacements when >90% of a file changed, preventing misleading diffs at zero token cost
- **Cross-file validation** — validates import/export consistency across all project files, catching broken references before they reach the preview
- **Impact analyzer** — computes topological modification order, parallelizable tiers, and affected-but-unmodified files for dependency-aware execution
- **Ordered execution mode** — files with >3 modifications execute in dependency order with per-file validation and retry, using outlines for already-modified context
- **Checkpoint manager** — captures pre-modification file state for per-file rollback during repair escalation
- **Partial success support** — modifications that fix some files but roll back others now report `partialSuccess` with the list of rolled-back files through the full API stack
- **Richer auto-repair context** — repair prompts now include 5 lines of surrounding source code and the current attempt number, helping the AI pinpoint errors faster

### Changed
- Auto-repair now tries up to 5 attempts (was 3), giving the escalation ladder room to work through all tiers
- Modification engine routes execution: ≤3 files → single-shot, >3 files → ordered (dependency-aware)
- `ModifyProjectResponse` extended with `partialSuccess` and `rolledBackFiles` fields (shared types + both backend routes)
- Dependency graph extended with `getTopologicalOrder()` and `getTransitivelyAffected()` methods

### Removed
- `build-fixer.ts` and its tests — replaced by `DiagnosticRepairEngine`

## [1.2.0] - 2026-03-21

### Added
- **Automatic CRUD inference** — entity-based apps (blogs, task managers, contact lists, etc.) now automatically include add/edit/delete operations even when the prompt doesn't ask for them. Delete always requires confirmation. Stateless tools and games are excluded. All mutations use local state — Sandpack-compatible.
- **Multi-phase generation** — complex projects (>10 files) now generate in batched phases with cross-file context, producing more coherent code with fewer broken imports
- **Architecture planning** — AI plans the file structure, type contracts, and CSS variables before generating code; a review step catches dangling imports and missing types before execution begins
- **Live phase progress** — watch your app build phase by phase (scaffold → logic → UI → integration) with real-time SSE progress events in the chat
- **Heuristic fallback** — if AI planning fails, a deterministic plan builder takes over so generation always completes
- **Recipe phase fragments** — generation recipes (React SPA, Next.js + Prisma, etc.) now inject stack-specific guidance per phase for better fullstack output

### For contributors
- `GenerationPipeline` in `pipeline-factory.ts`: dedicated new-project pipeline, separate from `PipelineOrchestrator` (modification-only)
- `ArchitecturePlanSchema`: extended planning schema with `typeContracts`, `cssVariables`, `stateShape`, `layer` assignments, and per-file `exports`/`imports` contracts
- `batch-context-builder.ts`: data-driven cross-phase context passing (type definitions, dependency content, file summaries, CSS variables, contracts)
- `phase-executor.ts`: single-phase execution with 2-attempt retry, truncation detection, and per-phase post-validation
- `phase-prompts.ts`: distinct system prompts for scaffold, logic, UI, and integration phases with contract injection
- 3 generation eval cases (`eval.test.ts`): offline snapshot-based eval for simple, medium, and complex prompts (passing ≥70)
- Named constants: `COMPLEXITY_GATE_FILE_THRESHOLD`, `UI_BATCH_SPLIT_THRESHOLD`, `INPUT_TOKEN_SAFETY_THRESHOLD`, and per-phase token budgets in `constants.ts`

### Changed
- **Generation and modification are now separate pipelines** — new projects route through `GenerationPipeline`, modifications through `PipelineOrchestrator`
- `IPromptProvider` extended with multi-phase prompt methods (`getArchitecturePlanningPrompt()`, `getPlanReviewPrompt()`, `getPhasePrompt()`)
- `ApiPromptProvider` and `ModalPromptProvider` implement per-phase context injection

### Fixed
- Magic number duplication: threshold constants now imported from `constants.ts` rather than defined inline
- **Parser wrapped format** — incremental JSON parser now correctly extracts files from `{ files: [] }` wrapper format
- **Model IDs** — replaced invalid OpenRouter model IDs in agent-config.json with working alternatives
- **Plan review boolean coercion** — PlanReview `valid` field now correctly coerced from string to boolean
- **Modification validation scope** — modification pipeline no longer fails with "Missing package.json" for partial file updates
- **Agent config model** — updated default model to `google/gemini-2.5-flash` (gemini-2.0-flash-001 was discontinued)
- **Upload route error headers** — 500 error responses from `/api/upload` now include CORS and rate-limit headers (previously missing, causing browser CORS failures on internal errors)

## [1.1.0] - 2026-03-20

### Added
- **Recipe-based generation architecture**: Pluggable recipe system for React SPA, Next.js + Prisma, and Next.js + Supabase Auth project types
- **Fullstack prompt fragments**: NEXTJS_API_PATTERNS, DATABASE_SCHEMA_GUIDANCE, AUTH_SCAFFOLDING_GUIDANCE, FULLSTACK_STRUCTURE
- **Fragment registry**: Central registry mapping fragment keys to prompt text with startup validation
- **Feature flag**: `ENABLE_FULLSTACK_RECIPES` env var (default: false) to gate fullstack generation
- **Image upload endpoint**: POST /api/upload with magic byte validation, sharp re-encoding, Supabase Storage upload
- **Client-side image upload**: Paste/drop image support with client-side resize and preview
- **Redis rate limiter**: Redis-backed sliding window rate limiter with Lua script and fail-open fallback
- **Generation eval suite**: 5 reference prompts with weighted scoring (file count, patterns, CSS, package.json validity)
- **Fullstack preview banner**: Detects fullstack projects and shows "available after export" banner in preview
- **Console panel**: SandpackConsole toggle in preview panel for viewing console.log output
- **Smart contextual suggestions**: Next-step suggestion chips based on generated project type
- **Rich generation progress**: Pipeline stage labels enriched with plan/intent context
- **Generation summary card**: Post-generation card showing file stats, mini tree, and dependency tags
- **Enhanced onboarding wizard**: 3-step wizard (project type → features → design style) generating optimized prompts
- **Production templates**: Expanded from 8 to 22 templates across 7 categories
- **Fullstack-aware export**: ZIP export with context-aware README, .env.example, Docker Compose, .gitignore
- **Frontend tests in CI**: Added frontend test step to CI workflow
- **Pipeline stage SSE events**: Frontend now processes `pipeline-stage` SSE events as progress updates

### Changed
- `applyRateLimit` is now async (supports Redis backend)
- Intent prompt now requests `projectType` classification (spa/fullstack/fullstack-auth)
- `IntentOutputSchema` extended with optional `projectType` field
- `PlanOutputSchema` extended with optional `apiRoutes`, `databaseModels`, `authStrategy` fields
- Pipeline orchestrator selects recipe after intent stage and updates prompt provider
- `ApiPromptProvider` accepts optional recipe and delegates to `composeExecutionPrompt` when set
- Export service generates context-aware metadata based on detected project stack (Prisma, Supabase, Next.js)

### Fixed
- Prompt contradiction: replaced Inter font reference with Geist Sans in shared prompt fragments
- Removed glassmorphism mention from design system constants
- Wired requestId from route context through to pipeline orchestrator
- Fixed unnecessary `as any` casts in recipe engine and pipeline orchestrator
- Fixed CORS header handling in upload route (proper AppError propagation for CSRF 403s)
